# PATHFINDER
In ancient Indian mythology, a player seeks the "Chintamani," a gem of wisdom and power, hidden in Indra's Sky Palace, guarded by celestial beings and magical traps. As the chosen seeker, navigate teleporting tiles to reach the temple's heart. Each tile is a decision point. Right choices move you forward; wrong ones push you back.
